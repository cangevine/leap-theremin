leap-theremin
=============

A theremin made with the LEAP motion device.  Plugin your LEAP device make sure it is on and run this in a web browser (on a local web server) and use a pencil or chopstick to move further from the device and closer to adjust the tone's frequency.  The further the pointer is the longer the wave and the closer the pointer the shorter the wave and thus a higher frequency.
